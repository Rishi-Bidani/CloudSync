# CloudSync

This program will allow you to host your own cloud. The goal is to make a self hosting platform similar to google drive's desktop client,
which will watch changes in a particular folder on your computer and upload those files directly to your server (Yes, the server is also hosted by you!).

During the setup you can choose which folder to watch - this will be referred to as the "watched folder" ahead. 
By default inside the watched folder - this program will ignore all files in a subfolder called "ignored"


## Main features I'm currently working on

- [ ] Implement some security authentication features
- [ ] Work on being able to download files from the server
